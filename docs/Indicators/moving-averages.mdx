# Moving Averages

## Simple Moving Average

<IndicatorDescription indicator_id="SMA"/>

### Example

For example, to calculate a 3 day simple moving average:

-   gather the price from the current, and previous two days
-   take the average across those three data points

```
# SMA result where window size n = 3
input  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
output = [-, -, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# note the two blank values at the start of the output. This is because a
# 3 day moving average requires at least 3 data points to be calculated.
```
