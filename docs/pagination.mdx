# Pagination

## Overview

All `api.maplechart.com` endpoints will only return a certain amount of data in response to a request. If you request
more data than what can be returned in a single response, the api will paginate the results, returning one page at a time.

You'll know your results have been paginated when the response json object includes a `next_token` property. You are responsible for
checking for the `next_token` on applicable endpoints and submitting additional requests to "paginate" through the remaining results. If
the `next_token` attribute is missing in the json response, there are no additional pages to paginate through.

<br />

:::info
Not all endpoints are designed to return the same amount of data per page. Also, be careful not to paginate through the results too quickly
or you will receive a 429 "Too many requests" throttling error.

## Python 3 Example

The below code showcases in simple terms, how to interact with a `next_token` and pass it in subsequent requests. If you are using
this api for a critical or production application, you might want to write logic for handling unexpected status code (errors).

```py {9,14,16} showLineNumbers title='Get the 200-day simple-moving-average timeseries for ETH/USD'
import requests
import time

URL = "https://api.maplechart.com/signals/sma-200d/history?pair=eth-usd"

data = []
r = requests.get(URL).json()
data.extend(r["data"])
next_token = r.get("next_token")

while next_token:

    # pass 'next_token' from previous response as parameter to next response
    r = requests.get(URL, params={"next_token": next_token}).json()
    data.extend(r["data"])
    next_token = r.get("next_token")

    time.sleep(0.2)  # to avoid api throttling

print(data)
```
