## Indicators

`Indicators` are hopefully self explanatory. They are technical analysis indicators. Think of these as representing a general formula that can have different
inputs.

Examples:

-   SMA _(Simple Moving Average)_ - A simple average, using closing price, taken across the previous 'N' trading days
-   RSI _(Relative Strength Index)_ - Meant to illustrate if an asset is "overbought" or "oversold" using a scale of 0-100
-   TR _(Trailing Return)_ - The percentage change between the current closing price and the closing price 'N' days prior

## Signals

`Signals` represent the _specifc_ calculation of an indicator. There is a 1 to many
relationship between indicators and signals. In other words, an indicator might have 1 or more signals related
to it. But a signal will always relate to only one indicator.

Examples:

-   SMA-200D - 'SMA' indicator calculated using a 200 day lookback period
-   SMA-50D - 'SMA' indicator calculated using a 50 day lookback period
-   TR-30D - 'TR' indicator calculated using a 30 day lookback period

## Pairs

`Pairs` represent trading-pairs. They consist of two currencies, a base currency and a quote currency. Generally
the first symbol represents the 'base' currency and the second symbol represents the 'quote' currency. Maple chart
refers to pairs in the following format(s): `BASE/QUOTE` or `base-quote`.

Examples of valid pairs:

-   `BTC/USD` Bitcoin quoted in United States Dollars
-   `ETH/USD` Ether quoted in United States Dollars
-   `eth-btc` Ether quoted in Bitcoin

<br />

:::tip Tip

When reading 'quotes' or 'prices' for a given trading pair, they can be interpreted as 1 Base Currency = X quote currency

Examples:

-   `BTC/USD = $26,000` _1 Bitcoin is worth 26,000 USD_
-   `ETH/BTC = 0.066` _1 Ether is worth 0.066 Bitcoin_
