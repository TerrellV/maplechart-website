This JSON schema describes the structure of the json object returned by the /indicators endpoint. The returned object has a property called "data", which is a list containing one or more items. Each item in the list represents an indicator and has several properties such as "indicator_id", "name", "description", and "signal_ids".

The "indicator_id" property is a string that uniquely identifies the indicator. The "name" and "description" properties are strings that provide a brief description of the indicator. The "signal_ids" property is a list of strings that represent the IDs of the signals associated with the indicator.
