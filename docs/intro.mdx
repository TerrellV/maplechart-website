## Quick Start ~30 Sec

Submit a GET request to the url below to fetch the full **100D & 200D Simple Moving Averages** and for the **BTC/USD** currency pair. Note, you can only request metrics for a single currency pair at a time. For example you can fetch the 25D, 50D, & 200D, simple moving average for BTC/USD in one call but if you want the same indicators for ETH/USD, you will need to make a new api call.
