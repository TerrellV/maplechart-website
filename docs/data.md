# Data

# Core Data

Core data is used as the basis for derived data. It's sourced externally from [CoinGecko.com's API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). Fields such as "price", "volume", "marketcap", and "rank" are core data fields. Basic cleaning steps are applied to ensure data is ready to be fed into maplechart.com metric calculations. Cleaning steps include:

* removing duplicate values
* basic formatting
* filling empty gaps in price data using a linear interpolation method
* rounding of decimals based on significant digits

Its important to read ðŸ‘€ [coingecko's API terms](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api_terms) before using the maplechart api.

## Metrics - Derived Data

Metrics (aka indicators) are derived data fields. They rely on either core data fields, or other metrics to be calculated. **All metrics are calculated by maplechart.com** using generally accepted formulas where it makes sense.

All **metrics are scheduled ðŸ•› to update daily**. Calculations should be complete by appoximately 00:40:00 UTC time (40  min after global candle close). This timing may vary based on the uptime and availability of coingecko's api, and the uptime and availability of maplechart.com's cloud services. We're actively exploring ways to improve this calculation delay. We expect the current timing to meet most people's needs.
